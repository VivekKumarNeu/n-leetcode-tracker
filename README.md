## Spaced Repetition Schedule

When you solve a problem, it's scheduled for review:

| Confidence Level | Review Interval |
|-----------------|-----------------|

## Tips

1. **Start small**: Begin with 2 problems per day
2. **Use hints**: Don't struggle too long - get a hint and learn
3. **Review regularly**: Spaced repetition is key to retention
4. **Track time**: This helps gauge your improvement
5. **Focus on patterns**: Understanding patterns > memorizing solutions
